# Notes on patterns --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# fm:aa:something/*        Fnmatch (default if not specified for --exclude / --exclude-from)
#                          '*'      = any number of characters
#                          '?'      = any single character (use [?] to match '?')
#                          '[...]'  = any single character specified, including ranges
#                          '[!...]' = any character not specified
#                          path separator is not treated specially
#                          - For a path to match a pattern, the full path must match,
#                            or it must match from the start of the full path to just before a path separator.
#                          - Except for the root path, paths will never end in the path separator when matching is attempted.
#                            Thus, if a given pattern ends in a path separator, a ‘*’ is appended before matching is attempted.
#                          -> A leading path separator is always removed.
# sh:/home/*/.thumbnails   shell match (default for --pattern / --patterns-from)
#                          Like fm, but in addition:
#                          **/ = zero or more directory levels
#                          *   = zero or more arbitrary characters with the exception of any path separator
#                          -> A leading path separator is always removed.
# re:^/home/[^/]\.tmp/     regex match  Note: foo/ is "content of foo, but not foo itself"
#                          see python doc for re module
# pp:root/somedir          path prefix match - useful to match whole sub-directories
#                          pp:root/somedir matches root/somedir and everything therein.
#                          -> A leading path separator is always removed.
# pf:root/file.ext         path full-match
#                          it can not have any variable or unspecified parts - the full path must be given.
#                          pf:root/file.ext matches root/file.ext only.
#                          -> A leading path separator is always removed.

# root dir - all backuped files will be relative to this since 1.2+
# you can give several roots, it is equivalent to provide several paths to "borg create"
# it may be more efficient to provide several roots than 1 root and a few include paths if the root contains a lot of directories

# use + to include
#     - to exclude

# The first matching pattern is used
# so if an include pattern matches before an exclude pattern, the file is backed up.
